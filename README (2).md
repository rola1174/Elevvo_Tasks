# Forest Cover Type Classification

## Project Overview
This project predicts **forest cover types** using machine learning classification models based on cartographic environmental features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains geographic and environmental variables such as:
- Elevation
- Aspect
- Slope
- Distance to hydrology
- Distance to roadways
- Hillshade measurements
- Wilderness area indicators
- Soil type indicators

**Target:** Cover_Type (forest class)

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
5. Model comparison

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
